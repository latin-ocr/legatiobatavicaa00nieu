First Latin Edition of Nieuhofs's account of the embassy Which traveled to
China to extend the trade of the Dutch East Indies Co. >The Dutch at the
height of their power, having supplanted the Portuguese‚ wanted to gain ac-
cess to China and a portion of the Chinese trade. After much opposition the
Government succeeded in sending certain merchants to try the pulse of the
Chinese in Canton. Upon their report it was determined to dispatch ambas-
sadors fron] Batavia to the Court of Peking to s'olicit lberty to trade. This,
the embassy report, was written by Nieuhoff, who was steward to the
ambassadors.

The fine engravings illustrate views of cities, towns, pagodas, palaces,

costumes, plants and fruits, and animals found in Peking, Canton, Nanking‚
etc.
